### difference between maps and structs:

## MAP
all keys must be the same type

all values must be the same type

keys are indexed - we can iterate over them

use to represent a collection of related properties

don't need to know all the keys at compile time

reference type!

## STRUCT
values can be of different type

keys don't support indexing

value type!

you need to know all the different fields at compile time

use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties
